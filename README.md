__Installation:__

gem install viddl-rb

__Usage:__

Download a video:  
    ```viddl-rb http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4```

Viddl-rb supports the following command line options:
```
-e, --extract-audio              Save video audio to file
-u, --url-only                   Prints url without downloading
-t, --title-only                 Prints title without downloading
-f, --filter REGEX               Filters a video playlist according to the regex (Youtube only right now)
-s, --save-dir DIRECTORY         Specifies the directory where videos should be saved
-d, --downloader TOOL            Specifies the tool to download with. Supports 'wget', 'curl' and 'net-http'
-h, --help                       Displays the help screen
```

Download a video and extract the audio:  
    ```viddl-rb http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4 --extract-audio```

In both cases we'll name the output file according to the video title.

Setting the video save directory:  
    ```viddl-rb http://vimeo.com/38372260 --save-dir C:/myvideos```

The --save-dir option works with both absolute and relative paths (relative based on the directory viddl-rb is run from).
If you want to save to a folder with spaces in it, you have to quote the path like this: --save-dir "C:/my videos"

__Youtube plugin specifics:__  

Download all videos on a playlist:  
    ```viddl-rb http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7E8DA0A515924126```

Download all videos from a user:  
    ```viddl-rb http://www.youtube.com/user/tedtalksdirector```

Filter videos to download from a user/playlist:  
    ```viddl-rb http://www.youtube.com/user/tedtalksdirector --filter /internet/i```

The --filter argument accepts a regular expression and will only download videos where the title matches the regex.
It uses the same syntax as Ruby regular expression literals do.

__Library Usage:__

```ruby
require 'viddl-rb'

download_urls = ViddlRb.get_urls("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4")
download_urls.first     # => "http://o-o.preferred.arn06s04.v3.lscac ..."
```

The ViddlRb module has the following module public methods:

* __get_urls_names(url)__
-- Returns an array of one or more hashes that has the keys :url which
points to the download url and :name which points to the name 
(which is a filename safe version of the video title with a file extension).
Returns nil if the url is not recognized by any plugins.

* __get_urls_exts(url)__
-- Same as get_urls_names but with just the file extension (for example ".mp4")
instead of the full filename, and the :name key is replaced with :ext.
Returns nil if the url is not recognized by any plugins.

* __get_urls(url)__
-- Returns an array of download urls for the specified video url.
Returns nil if the url is not recognized by any plugins.

* __get_names(url)__
-- Returns an array of filenames for the specified video url.
Returns nil if the url is not recognized by any plugins.

* __io=(io_object)__
-- By default all plugin output to stdout will be suppressed when the library is used.
If you are interested in the output of a plugin, you can set an IO object that
will receive all plugin output using this method. For example:

```ruby
require 'viddl-rb'

ViddlRb.io = $stdout     # plugins will now write their output to $stdout
```

All the __get__ methods in the ViddlRb module will raise either a ViddlRb::PluginError or a ViddlRb::DownloadError if the plugin fails. 
A ViddlRb::PluginError is raised if the plugin fails in an unexpected way, and a ViddlRb::DownloadError is raised if the video could not be downloaded for some reason. 
An example of that is if a Youtube video is not embeddable - then it can't be downloaded.

```ruby
begin
  ViddlRb.get_urls(video_url)
rescue ViddlRb::DownloadError => e
  puts "Could not get download url: #{e.message}"
rescue ViddlRb::PluginError => e
  puts "Plugin blew up! #{e.message}\n" +
       "Backtrace:\n#{e.backtrace.join("\n")}"
end
```
